# ClassBoom #

Classboom is an easy-to-use learning platform. This project was initially the class project of the Basic Programming course at the university of Tehran but I decided to move forward with it and make it more advanced. Classboom is designed with simplicity in mind and seeks to provide intuitive functionalities. Thus, I decided to add very limited front-end to this project to make it not only super extensible and future-proof but also extermely customizable and tunable to every user's needs.
- It currently supports the following features for professors:
    - Upload various lectures recordings
    - Assign as many assignments as necessary for every lesson
    - Evaluate the submitted answers to the assignments
- And it has the following features for students:
    - Stream the uploaded lectures
    - Submit answers to the assignments
    - View the scores given to the said answers

### Installaion: ###
Installation is super easy as this is a django server, just clone the repository and setup your personal prefrences in manage.py. It even comes with a temporary front-end so that you can tune the settings to your liking.

### Execution: ###
After you've set your desired settings, you can easily run the server using python and django with a single command:

` python3 manage.py runserver `

### Demo: ###
The main area of concentration on this project was the back-end, however here's some photos with the temporary front-end so that you can see the various functinalities it provides:

### Contributors: ###
This project was mainly developed by Aaron Bateni (myself).
