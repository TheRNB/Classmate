# ClassBoom #

Classboom is an attempt to develop an easy-to-use learning platform. This project was initially the class project of the Basic Programming course at the university of Tehran but I decided to move forward with it and make it more advanced. Classboom is designed with simplicity in mind and seeks to provide intuitive functionalities, especially the ability to use various different themes for it's front-end to suit every academy's needs.
- It currently supports the following features for professors:
    - Upload various lectures recordings
    - Assign as many assignments as necessary for every lesson
    - Evaluate the submitted answers to the assignments
- And it has the following features for students:
    - Stream the uploaded lectures
    - Submit answers to the assignments
    - View the scores given to the said answers

### Installaion: ###
Installation is super easy as this is a django server, just clone the repository and setup your personal prefrences in manage.py. It even comes with a temporary front-end so that you can tune the settings to your liking.

### Execution: ###
After you've set your desired settings, you can easily run the server using python and django with a single command:

` python3 manage.py runserver `

### Demo: ###
The main area of concentration on this project was the back-end, however here's some photos with the temporary front-end so that you can see the various functinalities it provides:

### Contributors: ###
This project was mainly developed by Aaron Bateni (myself).
